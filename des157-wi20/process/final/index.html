                    The scribes were treated with respect, 
                    and they amassed wealth and gained 
                    a positive reputation because they had 
                    the right to control the content in the 
                    texts. </br></br>
                    The scribes that control the flow 
                    of information can create fake stories 
                    to influence the public perspectives or 
                    regulate the treatment of a specific 
                    group in the community.

                    Even though many articles that have a bibliography, readers still need to verify the authenticity of material because readers are not only the viewers of the article but also the inspectors of the case.

                    As mentioned previously, even though some articles may look like academic sources which have a detailed work cited pages, not all of them offer scholarly analysis. Some internet authors only make them look like academic articles, and therefore, as readers, we must carefully read the articles before sharing them.
