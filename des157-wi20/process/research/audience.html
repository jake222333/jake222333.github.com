                Since my mom likes to read news from the internet, I interviewed my mom and asked why she believes the people that she follows on WeChat.


            </p>

            <p>

                She answered:
                I subscribe to a channel that gives a lot of information about health life. Also, the manners and style of the owner of the channel push me to believe that she is a reliable person. Furthermore, getting information about health on the internet is much easier than visiting a doctor. If I don’t feel well, the first choice will be searching on Google because there are many websites that can tell me what to do to address the health issue (Luo).
                


            </p>

            <p>

        
                From my mother’s perspective on social media and the internet, I discover that she believes the people that she follows because she feels that they are credible people by looking at their appearances and manners. However, she does not bother checking on their careers, jobs and whether they belong to a reputable organization. 



            </p>


            <p>

        
                Therefore, I would like to create a web page that shows the cause or the effect of fake news on the internet. Through this website, I hope the reader can raise awareness for the dangers of spreading fake news.
