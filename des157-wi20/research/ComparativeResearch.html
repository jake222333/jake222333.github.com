                History of the Web is an interactive introductory website that tells visitors about the history of website by scrolling with the mouse. The web designer uses a lot of images, animation and text to create motions to tell the story, and he makes every proportion of the web has interaction with the viewers, so they are more likely to read all the content. There is not a lot of text on the web, but there are many images that convey how the design element has changed from the past to present. As mentioned, very few text on the site, but there are still many titles that let the viewer know which topic is talking about. Also, Everytime the user interacts with this website something will move or adjust, such as animation effects, moving layers, or interactive buttons.

                All in all, I think this website does a good job getting the user's attention and it would be a good format for a website that is supposed to educate the user. If the designer can add more interaction activities, it might be more interesting. What I mean is that besides scrolling with the mouse, providing another approach to the viewer, such as pressing butting or creating more sections for viewers to click. Other than that, this website successfully tells the story of the history of the web. As the inspiration of my project, this website taught me how to use different elements to create interactive action, and taught me how to use different elements to tell a story on a website.Many interactive websites, such as community sites, can only function by allowing people to add information. Members must be able to add and share messages. There have to be rules to determine who can see what information and what they are allowed to do. As well as websites where interactivity is a fundamental requirement, there are times when it offers subtler benefits.

                The Virtual Gas Industry Museum exists only in virtual space. The task was to create virtual exhibitions. They are responsible for the overall design and implementation of the website. This website is a great example to learn about the usage of simple animation. I like how the designer combines design patterns with pictures, and these make his graphic unique. The good thing I found is that even though this website is informational, there are some sections with very few text. This makes me feel not stress out.

                This is not too much animation on the web, but makes me feel it is just clean and legible. There is a number on the side which is to indicate which section I am browsing. When introducing some tool in the gas industry, the viewer can have a zoom-in view to look at the detail of these tools, so this is a function I might want to add to my project. There are some errors on the web. For instance, there is overlap between some pictures. Probably add some more animation, but not too much. Also, the designer can add more different backgrounds because there is only one background on the page. Another aspect that I like is there is a feedback option at the bottom of the website. This is good for the owner to collect feedback from the potential clients, and get feedback on how to make the business run better. I choose this website as a reference because I have not had a deep understanding about Javascript, so I donâ€™t want my project to be too complicated. This is a good example that I can study for its clean design. It guides users and visitors on the site to their desired location of information.
